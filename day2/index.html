<p><em>[<a href="../materials/MCalle_slides_microbiome_UPC2022_2.pdf">Presentation 2</a>]</em></p>
<p>With compositional data (CoDa) like microbial abundances we can only aim for a representation of what is happening there, but it is not possible to obtain the true composition. Furthermore, the different samples have different total counts, which makes them non comparable. Therefore, this data is normally analysed in terms of <strong>relative data</strong>. The main problem with <strong>relative data</strong> is that it <strong>is restricted: all the elements add up to a certain value</strong> (usually 1). With this restriction come some important problem.</p>
<h4 id="problems-of-compositional-data-for-its-analysis">Problems of compositional data for its analysis</h4>
<p>Let's imagine this scenario, illustrated by <em>Figure 1</em>: we have two different samples composed by the same elements, and have exactly the same "absolute" abundances for all of the elements except for one. However, <strong>one change in the "absolute" abundance modifies the relative abundances of all elements</strong>. </p>

</table>
<p>This characteristic of compositionall data comes with certain problems. For the analysis of microbiome data, we highlight the following three:</p>
<p><strong>Supurious correlations:</strong> analyzing restricted data (in this case, the sum of all values is equal to 1) leads to spurious correlations, since when an element increases its relative abundance, the others decrease theirs (<em>Figure 2</em>). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematically, <strong>if we have a dataset with two taxas and any given number of samples, the correlation between their relative abundances is always -1</strong>: there is an <strong>inverse, proportional change in their relative abundances</strong> because when one <em>increases</em>, the other one <em>decreases</em> (the reason for the negative "-" sign) with a change of the same magnitude (here you have the "1", because it is completely proportional). In a more complex dataset (more taxa) just because of the transformation in relative abundances, two or more variables will obtain negative correlations, even if there is no negative correlation between "absolute" abundances. <strong>The more taxa you have, the least bias you will obtain.</strong> But not any kind of taxa, but mainly effective components (Shannon's index exponential, <em>Day 1 lesson</em>). </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Subcompositional incoherences:</strong> correlation between two taxa differ when a third taxa is removed (variable selection, for example (<em>Figure 3</em>). </p>
<p><strong>False positive rates in differential abundance testing:</strong> as a consecuence of the mentioned challenges, it is frequent to obtain a high rato of false positives when analyzing compositional data (<em>Figure 4</em>).</p>

<h4 id="properties-of-compositional-data">Properties of compositional data</h4>
<p>The fact that information is relative means that each data point does is not informative <em>per se</em>, it depends on the values of the other elements. This restricted space where the composition is defined is called <strong>simplex</strong>, and it has a different geometry due to its restriction.</p>
<p>The three main principles of CoDa are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Permutation invariance:</strong> elements can be arrenged in any given order without affecting analyses</li>
<li><strong>Scale invariance:</strong> multiplying by a constant should not affect the analyses. </li>
<li><strong>Sub-compositional coherence:</strong> important, since we usually work with sub-compositions (i.e., variable selection)</li>
</ol>
<p>We will focus on the last two of them</p>
<h6 id="scale-invariat-transformations">Scale-invariat transformations</h6>
<p>This transformations allow to move our date from the <em>simplex</em> to the real space maintaining the distance between samples. The most popular and simple transformations are log-ratios. There several types: <strong>log-proportions</strong> (log TSS), <strong>alr</strong>, <strong>clr</strong>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In clr-transformation, the log of each abundance is divided by the geometric mean of the abundances. The geometric mean is the arithmetic mean of the log values. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, <strong>these transformations apply a certain bias when calculating the differential abundance between two samples</strong>. As we can see in <em>Figure 5</em>, log-proportions have a bias that depends on both the changes in abundances and in the proportions of the abundances. </p>

<h4 id="proposed-solution-compositional-balances-coda4microbiome">Proposed solution: compositional balances (coda4microbiome)</h4>
<p><strong>There is no transformations that entirely solves this problems</strong>. Similar to CLR, there are some other transformations like ARL or IRL, but all of them have some drawbacks. Malu and his colaborators came up with a different approach as a <strong>solution</strong>: using <strong>log-contrasts, which refer to the balances between two sub-compositions (taxa A and taxa B) of a composition.</strong> </p>
<p>The latest approach for this solution was to combine these log-contrasts with an <strong>elastic net</strong>, which is a penalized regression that allows to combine both types regularization (type 1 LASSO and type 2 RIDGE). This approach, implemented in the <em>coda4microbiome</em> R package, <strong>considers all the pairwise compositional balances, assigns each balance a coefficient and</strong>, since it uses elastic net, <strong>allows to reduce the number of variables</strong> by shrinking the coefficients of non-informative variables (log-contrasts) to 0. </p>
<p>This log-contrast is an invariant function, since the sum of all coefficients is 0 (therefore, multiplying by a constant won't change the results). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sum of all coefficients is 0 because of the nature of compositional data? My guess is that it is due to the restriction of the sum of relative abundances being 1: if some relative abundances increase from a given sample to another, some other abundances will decrease. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>most remarkable thing about this approach</strong> is that an easy <strong>reparametrization allows to directly relate the abundance of each marker with a given trait</strong>. </p>
<p>Malu has a very nice <a href="https://malucalle.github.io/statistical-pills/coda4microbiome_explore_logratios.html">tutorial</a> on how to apply the log-contrast (or log-ratio) approach to explore both continuous and binary variables using the <em>coda4microbiome</em> package.</p>
