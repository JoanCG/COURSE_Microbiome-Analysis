The notes from the course [*Statistical Methods for Microbiome Analysis*](https://mesioupcub.masters.upc.edu/en/xv-summer-school-2022/courses/statistical-methods-for-microbiome-analysis), organized by MESIO UPC-UB XV Summer School, are available in [**this website**](https://joancg.github.io/curso_microbiomeAnalysis/)

The course was taught by [Malu Calle](https://mon.uvic.cat/bms/members/malu/), from Universidad de Vic. 

I took the course presentially in the [Faculty of Mathematics and Statistics of the UPC](https://goo.gl/maps/8EPcCEvetAzZStP3A) from 20 to 23 June of 2022. **In total, the course lasted 15 hours**

## Course objectives

1. Descriptive analysis and visualization

2. Differential abundance analysis (small datasets):

	- **Multivariate:** Are there differences between microbial abundances?
	- **Univariado:** Which are the microorganisms that are differentially abundant?
